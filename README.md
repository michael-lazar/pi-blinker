# pi-blinker

This is a little script that runs on my Raspberry Pi and blinks a blue LED whenever I get a star on github.

It's a nice script, and I like it.

## Hardware

- 1 blue LED
- 1 resistor, 560 ohm
- 2 small wires
- 3 inches of electrical tape

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/michael-lazar/pi-blinker.git
$ sudo pi-blinker/install.sh
```
